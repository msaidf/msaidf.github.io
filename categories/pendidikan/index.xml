      <description>In US, economics PhD students are sorted to different programs through selection criteria including standardized test, motivation letter, and references. This selection is not perfect in ranking the individual abilities, even less in matching the research interests. The motivation letter might describe research interests to help matching the students. However, there is no general rule how much weight is put on the interest matching than the individual abilities shown by standardized test, past academic performance, and reference letter.</description>
